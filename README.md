# Hi 👋, I'm Weston Cadena  
### HPC & ML Enthusiast | Parallel Computing | Texas A&M Grad

- 🔭 I’m currently a Graduate Compute Scholar Intern at **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory**, building tracing tools and parallel algorithms for large-scale graph analysis.  
- 🌱 I’m focused on **deep learning, distributed systems, and high-performance computing**.  
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source ML/HPC projects, hackathons, and research**.  
- 💡 Recent projects: 3D Gaussian scene fusion, scalable CLIP training, LLM parallelization, and AI-powered medical imaging tools.  
- 🏃 Outside of code, you’ll find me running marathons or tinkering with microcontrollers.
